## Features

Interactive visualization of LRU Page Replacement
Animated C-LOOK Disk Scheduling
Step-by-step execution
Built-in Quiz Mode
Designed for OS labs, exams, and placement preparation

## Algorithms

## LRU (Least Recently Used)
A page replacement algorithm that removes the page which has not been accessed for the longest time when memory frames are full.
Efficient memory utilization
Fewer page faults than FIFO
Used in virtual memory systems

## C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)
A disk scheduling algorithm where the disk head moves in a single direction, services all requests, and then jumps back to the start.
Reduced average seek time
Fair request handling
Suitable for high disk I/O workloads

## Objectives

Visualize core Operating System algorithms
Improve conceptual understanding
Support OS lab and academic learning
